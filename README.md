# Component Based Architecture 101

This is the GITHUB project for the video 'Internet Programming 101.
[COMPONENT BASED ARCHITECTURE 101](https://archive.org/details/component-based-architecture-PART1)

The examples here cover listing1.cs, listing2.cs and listing3.cs which explain the basic of components.
We also have samples that are used in Part 2 of the basic menu system and hotel resesrvation system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. These samples are for educatinal purposes only!. They are not meant to be used in a LIVE PRODUCTION enviornment for any reason.

### Prerequisites

To use this examples yo uwill need a working CSHARP (C#) Compiler. The examples used here used the built in compiler from Microsoft
(csc.exe). No additional software needs installed. However, if you wish to build on Linux you may wish to install the mono system.
For Debian/Ubuntu based systems you can issue the command

```
sudo apt-get install mono-complete
```

### Compiling

Compile each listing with the csc (or msc / linux) command. For example to compile the the file listing1.cs

```
csc listing1.cs
```

## Running the sample

Once compiled, simply run the program to see the output

Eg:

```
./listing1.exe
```

Programs should compile without any additional pre-requisies. Enjoy !
